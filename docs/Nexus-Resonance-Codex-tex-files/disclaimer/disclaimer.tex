	\textbf{Author's Note:} I realize that the claims in this paper are bold and may sound insane. I am having a hard time believing all of this myself. However, I have confirmed instant protein folding: as soon as the sequence is identified, it is solved/folded instantly in the 2048D limit. I have tested it on my own machines and verified the AI model enhancements. These enhancements are easy to utilize. Test it for yourself—it works, and it will not be a waste of your time. I intend to rewrite this paper eventually, but I needed to get these enhancements out because they can save lives \textit{now}. Patents take time; people need cures yesterday.
