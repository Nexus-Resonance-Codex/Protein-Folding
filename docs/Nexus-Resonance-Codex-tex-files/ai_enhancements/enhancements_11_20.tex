\subsection{Part II: Generation, Sparsity, \& Projection Stability (Enhancements 11-20)}

The second suite guarantees that outputs generated by the foundation architecture remain perfectly locked to the 2048D NRC Lattice structure algebraically, preventing hallucination cascades.

	title=\textbf{11. Prime-Density Conditioned Generation v3}
	]
	During decoding, logit distributions are explicitly biased utilizing the Prime Number Theorem aligned on the TUPT sequence. This guarantees biological sequences match naturally stable prime density states structurally instantly.

	title=\textbf{12. GTT Entropy Collapse Regulariser v2}
	]
	Monitors localized Shannon entropy dynamically across layers. If internal activation variance spikes beyond 10.96 nats, the layer acts as a physical heat sink, forcing the variance strictly down scaling by $1/\phi$.

	title=\textbf{13. $\phi^{-1}$ Momentum Accelerator v2}
	]
	An optimizer acting identical to SGDM but mapped perfectly to the golden ratio boundaries mathematically. Valid momentum trajectories accelerate continuously by $\phi$, while noisy updates are immediately damped completely by $1/\phi$.

	title=\textbf{14. 3-6-9-7 Attractor Synchronisation Seed v2}
	]
	Sets system-level deterministic behavior natively across highly parallelized GPU matrices. It forces all RNG events physically onto the Module 9 geometric cycle, eliminating pure randomness from network executions.

	For spatial tensor processing. Implements the QRT resonance wave natively into moving sliding grids, protecting 4D topological extraction from structural destruction.

	]
	Tracks sequences via the 2D causal masking grid, substituting dense block operations by organically tearing down computation channels corresponding to mathematical biological noise mapped onto the Mod 2187 path boundaries.

	title=\textbf{17. $\phi$-Powered Resonant Weighting}
	]
	Intermediate activations passing forward in processing networks actively detect their own variance bounds and structurally divide/multiply values routing everything explicitly directly onto universal attractor constants.

	Applies a rigid transformation matrix forcing incoming arbitrary tensors permanently onto planes utilizing 51.85-degree physical rotation calculations matched perfectly with Golden Ratio limits.

	]
	Eliminates the rigid mathematical damage of $torch.nn.utils.clip\_grad\_norm\_$. Operates by applying the Macro-Scale Theorem proportionally dissolving extreme numerical vectors using continuous calculus damping instead of hard cutoffs.

	Creates a learning rate mapping scheduler cycling directly with the 24-step length limit of the Fibonacci series calculated specifically over Modulo-9 bounds natively.
