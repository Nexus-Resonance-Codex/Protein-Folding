# Nexus Resonance License (NRC-L) v2.0

**Effective Date: February 2026**

## Preamble

This License governs the use of the **Nexus Resonance Codex (NRC)** framework, including all mathematical models, algorithms, codebases, visual representations, and derivative materials (collectively, the **"NRC Materials"**) as applied to biological structures, protein folding dynamics, and related computational biochemistry, as detailed in the official NRC compiled documentation and related repository files.

The NRC framework promotes rigorous, resonant innovation. To balance open scientific collaboration with the protection of foundational intellectual property, this License adopts a dual-licensing model:

- **Non-commercial** and academic research use is granted freely to accelerate global discovery.
- **Commercial** exploitation requires an explicit, separate commercial agreement.
- **Harmful** or unethical applications are strictly prohibited.

## 1. Definitions

1.  **"NRC Materials"** refers to the mathematical frameworks, proofs, algorithms, architectures, and source code provided within this repository.
2.  **"Derivative Works"** refers to any modifications, extensions, integrations, or novel applications derived substantially from the NRC Materials.
3.  **"Commercial Use"** refers to any use of the NRC Materials for financial gain, monetization, incorporation into commercial products, or direct business applications.
4.  **"Biotech Applications"** refers to the use of NRC Materials in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, life sciences, drug discovery, structural biology, or related fields.
5.  **"Harmful Use"** refers to applications involving weaponry, unauthorized surveillance, environmental degradation, illegal activities, or purposes reasonably determined to be detrimental to humanity.
6.  **"Attribution"** refers to the mandatory crediting of "James Trageser (@jtrag) - Nexus Resonance Codex" alongside a direct link to the official organizational repository (https://github.com/Nexus-Resonance-Codex).
7.  **"Educational Purposes"** refers strictly to non-commercial learning, teaching, and academic research within recognized institutions or personal capacity, devoid of any intent to monetize the derivative directly or indirectly.

## 1.5. Reservation of Rights

All rights not expressly granted to you in this License are reserved and retained by Licensor (James Trageser). This License does not grant you any rights to use any trademarks, logos, or service marks associated with the Nexus Resonance Codex or James Trageser.

## 2. Non-Commercial Use (Open Academic Grant)

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge and royalty-free, to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and create Derivative Works from the NRC Materials solely for **non-commercial, educational, and academic research purposes**.

**Conditions of Grant**:

1.  **Attribution**: All copies and Derivative Works must clearly display Attribution to the original author and repository.
2.  **Share-Alike**: Derivative Works intended for public distribution must be released under this License or a strictly compatible open-source/open-science license (e.g., CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0).
3.  **Prohibition of Harmful Use**: The NRC Materials shall not be utilized for Harmful Use.

Under these conditions, the Licensor grants a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to any patents embodied within the NRC Materials for good-faith, non-commercial research.

## 3. Commercial Use & Royalties

**Any Commercial Use of the NRC Materials is strictly prohibited without prior written consent from the Licensor.**

Entities seeking to utilize the NRC Materials for Commercial Use—including but not limited to commercial biotech applications, proprietary drug discovery pipelines, or for-profit software services—must negotiate a separate Commercial License Agreement.

Such agreements will be structured equitably to reflect standard industry practices, potentially including upfront licensing fees, clinical milestone payments, and fair royalty structures based on net sales or derivative value.

Unauthorized Commercial Use constitutes a material breach of this License and intellectual property infringement, subject to full legal recourse.

## 4. Indemnification

1.  **Licensee Indemnity**: The Licensee agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Licensor (James Trageser) and any contributors from and against all legal claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses arising from the Licensee’s use of the NRC Materials, the creation of Derivative Works, or any breach of this License.
2.  **Limitation of Liability**: UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE NRC MATERIALS, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

## 5. No Warranty

THE NRC MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED **"AS IS"**, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY, ACCURACY, AND PERFORMANCE OF THE NRC MATERIALS IS BORNE BY THE LICENSEE.

## 6. Termination

This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach of its terms by the Licensee (including unauthorized Commercial Use or failure to provide Attribution). Upon termination, the Licensee must immediately cease all use of the NRC Materials and destroy all existing copies.

Survival clauses: Sections 1.5 (Reservation of Rights), 3 (Commercial Use), 4 (Indemnification), 5 (No Warranty), 7 (Governing Law), and 8 (Severability) shall survive any termination of this License.

## 7. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution

This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the federal laws of the United States of America, without regard to conflict of law principles.

Any dispute arising out of or relating to this License shall be subject to standard binding arbitration in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or Washington D.C., managed by a recognized arbitration association.

## 8. Severability

If any provision of this License is found to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed from the remainder of this License, which will remain in full force and effect to the maximum extent permitted by law.
